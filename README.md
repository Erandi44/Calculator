  o	Remainder (%)

Control Operations

  o	Terminate (#)
  o	Reset ($)


•	The program  ask the user to specify the desired operation (addition / subtraction / multiplication / division / power / remainder /terminate / reset). 

•	Once the user inputs / selects an arithmetic operation, the program ask the user to enter the two operands one by one, separated by Enter key. If the user made a 
  mistake while entering the parameters, he can return to main menu by pressing ‘$’ key at the end of the input string, followed by the Enter key

•	Calculate the result and display the result. Inputs are processed as floating point values, even thought the values entered are integers. Example: 2.0 + 4.0 = 6.0

•	Return to main menu after displaying the calculation result

•	The program keeps running until it is stopped by the user (using the terminate command #)
